This GitHub repository comprises a selection of code snippets that I created during my bachelor's degree as part of assignments.
The majority of these assignments were completed using the C programming language, while some of them involved the use of C++.
The operating system utilized for these assignments was Ubuntu.
All codes were tested and executed within the Linux terminal environment.
